📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing steel grades data to understand material properties, grade distribution, and key patterns using data analysis techniques.
The goal of this project is to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation using Python.

⚠️ Important Disclaimer
The dataset used in this project is completely dummy / synthetic data created only for learning and practice purposes.
It is NOT related to any real company, organization, or industrial data, and does not represent real steel specifications or business operations.

🎯 Objectives

Practice data analysis workflow end-to-end

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on steel grade data

Analyze:

Steel grade distribution

Chemical composition trends

Mechanical property variations

Generate meaningful insights and visualizations

Improve hands-on skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation & cleaning

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – analysis environment
